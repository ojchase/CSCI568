				<h2>Why Do We Care?</h2>
				<p>All the best data mining algorithms in the world will be utterly useless to us if the data we use is not good quality.  Add more stuff here...</p>

				<h2>Data Types</h2>
				<p>The first thing you have to be aware of is the types of data you're using.  I discovered in another project that binary data was more useful to me than a range of integer values, and so it took a good amount of time to binarize my data into a useful format.  Most data types fit one of two categories: Numeric or Categorical.  Some of the distinctions are related to the concept of <em>transformations</em>.  You may at some point find that your column of data from -48.2847 to 55 is not particularly convenient to work with and wish to change it to a 0 to 100 scale.  How you're allowed to do that will depend on the data type.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Numeric</h3>
						<p>These are pretty intuitive: any form of data that has a number attached.  You may have heard of them in science education as "quantitative" data.  We can further narrow this down into 
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Categorical</h3>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Notice too that these categories are just a little bit fuzzy.  For example, "red" and "blue" were classified above as nominal values, but they could </p>

<ul>
  <li>An introduction that summarizes the aspects of data you describe below.</li>
  <li>Descriptions of dataset types and attribute types, and why these types are important to think about (what are the "side effects" of different dataset types, such as temporal correlation?)</li>
  <li>An exposition about data quality. What are common problems? How are they handled? Specifically mention the case of human-generated data, citing BD.</li>
  <li>An exposition about exploring data. Why is it important? What are the common summary statistics? Show some screenshots of a data mining tool providing these stats.</li>
  <li>An exposition about visualizing data. Where does dataviz fit in the data mining process? Show an example of a visualization you created with Processing.</li>
