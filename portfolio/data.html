		<h1>Data & Data Quality</h1>
		<div id="Content">
			<div id="Intro">
				<h2>Why Do We Care?</h2>
				<p>All the best data mining algorithms in the world will be utterly useless to us if the data we use is not good quality.  Add more stuff here...</p>

				<h2>Data Types</h2>
				<p>The first thing you have to be aware of is the types of data you're using.  I discovered in another project that binary data was more useful to me than a range of integer values, and so it took a good amount of time to binarize my data into a useful format.  Most data types fit one of two categories: Numeric or Categorical.  Some of the distinctions are related to the concept of <em>transformations</em>.  You may at some point find that your column of data from -48.2847 to 55 is not particularly convenient to work with and wish to change it to a 0 to 100 scale.  How you're allowed to do that will depend on the data type.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Numeric</h3>
						<p>These are pretty intuitive: any form of data that has a number attached.  You may have heard of them in science education as "quantitative" data.  We can further narrow this down into interval or ratio data:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h4>Interval</h4>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Ratio</h4>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Categorical</h3>
						<p>Categorical data look obvious at first, but can be easily mixed up with the numeric data if you're not careful.  Why?  Because they often look like numbers, and will probably be represented in your data set with integers.  But there's an important subtle difference.  Categorical, or "qualitative", data represent <em>distinct</em> data elements, and can be nominal or ordinal.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h4>Nominal</h4>
								<p>I find nominal data to be the easiest, after interval numeric data above, to grasp intuitively.  These are distinct elements that don't have any particular ordering to them.  For example, if you're a bartering service, the available products would probably be nominal attributes: bookshelf, coffee maker, Newsboys CD, and so on.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Ordinal</h4>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Notice too that these categories are just a little bit fuzzy.  For example, "red" and "blue" were classified above as nominal values, but they could [AAAAAAAAA].  "Bob" and "Sue" are also nominal, but if you provide them with distinct employee IDs, then they can become sortable as ordinal data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An introduction that summarizes the aspects of data you describe below.</li>
  <li>Descriptions of dataset types and attribute types, and why these types are important to think about (what are the "side effects" of different dataset types, such as temporal correlation?)</li>
  <li>An exposition about data quality. What are common problems? How are they handled? Specifically mention the case of human-generated data, citing BD.</li>
  <li>An exposition about exploring data. Why is it important? What are the common summary statistics? Show some screenshots of a data mining tool providing these stats.</li>
  <li>An exposition about visualizing data. Where does dataviz fit in the data mining process? Show an example of a visualization you created with Processing.</li>
