		<h1>Cluster Analysis</h1>
		<div id="Content">
			<div id="Intro">
				<h2>Why Do We Care?</h2>
				<p>Cluster analysis allows us to find groups ("clusters") of related objects.  This may be useful in, for example, marketing, as you may want to create three different advertisements that would attract the most possible customers, without just attracting the same people multiple ways.</p>
				<p>Let's say you're trying to market a  productivity app.  You would apply cluster analysis to analyze your existing customer base and might discover that your ads will be the most effective if you target single moms, businessman dads, and overworked party animals.  This third category may not have been previously obvious, and it could indicate a underutilized market just waiting for your app.  Occasionally they find it on their own, and were thus found by the clustering algorithm, but think how many more you could get with some targeted advertising!</p>

				<h2>How Do We Do It?</h2>
				<p>As with the similarity metrics, there are multiple ways to cluster data, and none is perfect.  Perhaps the best one is still to be discovered, or is dependent on your specific use.  Here's a few, or you could always create your own!</p>
